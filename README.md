# PortAudio.Net
PortAudio.Net is a cross platform .NET wrapper for PortAudio.

## Status

## Initial Project Goals
* Create a P/Invoke wrapper targetting .NET Standard and .NET Core
* Support all un-deprecated functionality in PortAudio
* Supply a safe API to the greatest extent possible (no resource leaks, crashes, etc.)
* Follow good .NET patterns in the object model and in resource use, etc.
* Reach a 1.0 release with a promise of ongoing backward compatibility between subsequent releases
* Create a Nuget package and publish on NuGet.org

## Future Project Goals
* Target .NET Framework
* Investigate distributing native runtimes, subject to licensing and other considerations
